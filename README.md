# ML From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of Machine Learning algorithms and models from scratch. The purpose of this repository is to provide a simplistic form of these algorithms and match them to their respective libraries in Python.

## FAQs

#### Why are you doing this?

I am doing this to learn more about the inner workings of Machine Learning algorithms and models. I believe that by implementing these algorithms from scratch, I will have a better understanding of how they work and how they can be improved.

#### Why not just use libraries like `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow` or `pytorch`?

While libraries like `scikit-learn` and `tensorflow` are great for building Machine Learning models quickly, they abstract away a lot of the details of how these models work. By implementing these models from scratch, I can gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how they can be improved.

#### How do I know if my implementation is correct?

I will be comparing the results of my implementations to the results of the corresponding libraries in Python. If the results match, then I can be confident that my implementation is correct.

#### Can I use this in production?

Send me an email, I can tell you faster ways to get a headache :)
